\section{Compiler}

In the {\tt Compiler.sml} file we've added code for the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt makeArraySpace}, making room for arrays in the beginning of the {\tt DATA} section.
\item loopassert and ifassert for ensuring that the bijectivity holds.
\item added arrays to {\tt findvars} (trivial)
\item implemented {\tt makeReads}, {\tt makeWrites}, {\tt makeZero} and {\tt checkZero} for arrays. 
\item implemented arrays which can be used on both left- and righthand sides.
\item added {\tt compileCond}, which generates code for conditional statements.
\item implemented if and loop in {\tt compileStat}, which uses {\tt compileCond}.
\item added the {\tt uncall} function, which runs the code marked with \_backwards\_.
\item added reverseStatement, which defines the backwards code.
\item added \_backwards\_ to {\tt compileProcs}, generating the backwards code.
\end{itemize}
