\section{Compiler}

In the {\tt Compiler.sml} file we've added code for the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt makeArraySpace}, which created allocated space for arrays in the
      beginning of the {\tt DATA} section. The space could have been allocated
      anywhere in the {\tt DATA} section, but as it need to be aligned to a
      $4$-bit address, it is easiest to place it at the beginning of the
      section.
\item Assertion checking for {\tt if} and {\tt loop} to ensure that the
      bijectivity holds.
\item Added arrays to {\tt findvars} (trivial).
\item Implemented {\tt makeReads}, {\tt makeWrites}, {\tt makeZero} and
      {\tt checkZero} for arrays.
\item Implemented arrays which can be used on both left- and righthand sides.
\item Added {\tt compileCond}, which generates code for conditional statements
      using two jump positions.
\item Implemented {\tt if} and {\tt loop} in {\tt compileStat}, which uses
      {\tt compileCond}.
\item Added the {\tt uncall} function, which runs the code marked with
      {\tt \_backwards\_}.
\item Added {\tt reverseStatement}, reverses a statement (which could consist of
      multiple statements).
\item Added {\tt \_backwards\_} to {\tt compileProcs}, generating the reversed
      code using {\tt reverseStatement}.
\end{itemize}
