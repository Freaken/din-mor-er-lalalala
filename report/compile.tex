\section{Compiler}

In the {\tt Compiler.sml} file we have added code for the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\tt makeArraySpace}, which creates allocated space for arrays in the
      beginning of the {\tt DATA} section. The space could have been allocated
      anywhere in the {\tt DATA} section, but it needs to be aligned to a
      $4$-bit address. This could have been done e.g. by using the align-statement. 
      However, it is easier just to place it at the beginning of the section.
\item Assertion checking for {\tt if} and {\tt loop} to ensure that the
      bijectivity holds.
\item Added arrays to {\tt findvars} (trivial).
\item Implemented {\tt makeReads}, {\tt makeWrites}, {\tt makeZero} and
      {\tt checkZero} for arrays.
\item Implemented arrays, which can be used on both left hand and right hand sides.
\item Added {\tt compileCond}, which generates code for conditional statements
      using two jump positions.
\item Implemented {\tt if} and {\tt loop} in {\tt compileStat}, which uses
      {\tt compileCond}.
\item Added the {\tt uncall} function, which runs the code marked with
      {\tt \_backwards\_}.
\item Added {\tt reverseStatement}, which reverses a statement 
      (which could consist of multiple statements).
\item Added {\tt \_backwards\_} to {\tt compileProcs}, generating the reversed
      code using {\tt reverseStatement}.
\end{itemize}
