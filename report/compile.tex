\section{Compiler}

In the {\tt Compiler.sml} file we've added code for the following tasks:

\begin{itemize}
\item makeArraySpace, making room for arrays in the beginning of the {\tt DATA} section.
\item loopassert and ifassert for ensuring that the bijectivity holds.
\item added arrays to findvars (trivial)
\item implemented makeReads, makeWrites, makeZero and checkZero for arrays. 
\item implemented arrays which can be used on both left- and righthand sides.
\item added compileCond, which generates code for conditional statements.
\item implemented if and loop in compileStat, which uses compileCond.
\item added the uncall function, which runs the code marked with \_backwards\_.
\item added reverseStatement, which defines the backwards code.
\item added \_backwards\_ to compileProcs, generating the backwards code.
\end{itemize}
