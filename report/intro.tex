\section{Introduction}
Our additions to the partially complete compiler are divided into four
files, {\tt Parser.grm}, {\tt Lexer.lex}, {\tt Type.sml} and {\tt Compiler.sml}.
This report documents our additions in chapters corresponding to this division.

Some design choices were made, which are documented in a corresponding chapter.

\section{Design choices}

\paragraph{Aligning arrays.}
We also made a small change to {\tt Mips.sml} to include support for the
{\tt .align} statement.

\paragraph{Variables used on both sides of {\tt +=} or {\tt -=} statements.}
One restriction is that we cannot have expressions of the form \verb!a += a!.
Two special cases of this are

\paragraph{Requirements}

No overflow control
Runtime detection of bijectivity at program termination
Runtime detection of bijectivity of /2 operator?
Two variables of same name cannot be declared (regardless of type) (typecheck)
Two procedures cannot have the same name (typecheck)
Updating an identifier cannot happen by use of that identifier. (typecheck)
Sequences are performed sequentially from left to right.
Conditional statements work as expected.
Loop statements work as expected. (reference to asm and tests? compare to R()-table)
Procedure calls work recursively.
Procedure uncalls work as expected. (reference to code and tests)
Each operator (+=, -=, <, ==, !=, ...) work as expected.
Arrays work as expected.
