\section{Introduction}
Our additions to the partially complete compiler are divided into four
files, {\tt Parser.grm}, {\tt Lexer.lex}, {\tt Type.sml} and {\tt Compiler.sml}.
This report documents our additions in chapters corresponding to this division.

Additionally, design choices, fulfilling assignment requirements and testing
the code have corresponding chapters.

This report does not try to document the Janus programming language extensively,
but merely our implementation of parts of it. Some explanations have been made
explicit because we implement certain features.

``And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from
the darkness.'' \cite[Gen. 1:4]{bible}.
