\section{Introduction}
Our additions to the partially complete compiler are divided into four
files, {\tt Parser.grm}, {\tt Lexer.lex}, {\tt Type.sml} and {\tt Compiler.sml}.
This report documents our additions in chapters corresponding to this division.

We also made a small change to {\tt Mips.sml} to include support for the
{\tt .align} statement.
