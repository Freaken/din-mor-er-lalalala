\section{Lexer}
The missing lexical tokens were generated either directly by regular expression
rules (\verb+[+, \verb+]+, \verb+==+, \verb+<+, \verb+!+, \verb+&&+ and
\verb+||+), or as return values from the \verb+keyword+ function that gathers
all possible tokens matching the regular expression
\verb+[a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*+. This simplifies separation of keywords from
identifiers which otherwise share the same namespace. Keywords thus get
precedence over identifiers of similar names, making them ``reserved''.
