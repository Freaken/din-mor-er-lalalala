\section{Requirements}

\paragraph{No overflow control.} Arithmetic on 32-bit two's complement integers
has no overflow detection. This is a consequence of not explicitly adding it
through either MIPS interrupts or custom checking of sign bits.

\paragraph{Runtime detection of bijectivity.} We assert that programs are
bijective during runtime in two ways:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Temporary variables start their existence with the value zero (by way of
        the \verb+makeZero+ function, which we have extended to work for
        arrays), and at the end of a program, they must also have the value
        zero.  This is handled by the function \verb+checkZero+, which we have
        also extended to work for arrays.

        The code for \verb+checkZero+, as illustrated below, loads the value at
        each array index and jumps to \verb+_NonZero_+ if the value is not equal
        to zero:
\begin{verbatim}
...
| checkZero (Janus.ArrayVarDef (x,size,_)::defs) =
  let
    val startlabel = "_checkzerostart_" ^ newName()
    val arrayindex = "_index_" ^ newName()
    val countdown = "_counter_" ^ newName()
    val tmpvar = "_zero_tmp_var_" ^ newName()
  in
    [Mips.LA (arrayindex, "_array_" ^ x),
     Mips.LI (countdown, Int.toString(size)),
     Mips.LABEL startlabel,

     Mips.LW(tmpvar, arrayindex, "0"),
     Mips.BNE(tmpvar, "0", "_NonZero_"),

     Mips.ADDI(countdown, countdown, "-1"),
     Mips.ADDI(arrayindex, arrayindex, "4"),

     Mips.BNE("0", countdown, startlabel)] @
     checkZero defs
  end
\end{verbatim}

  \item The first condition of {\tt loop}-statements and the second condition
        of {\tt if}-statements are run-time assertions of bijectivity. 
        These assertions are handled in {\tt compileStat} using {\tt compileCond}, 
        which jumps to {\tt \_ifassertfail\_} or {\tt \_loopassertfail\_}.

        The function \verb+compileCond+ takes as argument a piece of abstract
        syntax corresponding to a condition, and two labels. It then produces
        MIPS code that corresponds to the comparisons and jumps to the first
        label if the comparison is successful and to the second label if not.

        The function \verb+compileStat+ takes advantage of this by switching the
        order of labels, as illustrated in the following code:

\begin{verbatim}
...
| Janus.If (c1,s1,s2,c2,(line,col)) =>
    let
      val endvar = "_ifend_" ^ newName()
      val cond1  = "_if1_" ^ newName()
      val cond2  = "_if2_" ^ newName()
    in
      compileCond c1 cond1 cond2 @
      Mips.LABEL cond1 ::
      compileStat s1 vars @
      compileCond c2 endvar "_ifassertfail_" @
      Mips.LABEL cond2 ::
      compileStat s2 vars @
      compileCond c2 "_ifassertfail_" endvar @
      [Mips.LABEL endvar]
    end
\end{verbatim}

The code for \verb+Janus.Loop+ is very similar.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Variables have unique names.} Two variables cannot have the same name
regardless of their type. This is seen in the pseudo-code for \verb+checkDefs+
and corresponds to the actual type check.

\paragraph{Procedures have unique names.} Two procedures cannot have the same
name. This is ensured in the function \verb+getProcs+ during the type check:

\begin{verbatim}
fun getProcs [] pnames = pnames
  | getProcs ((p,s,pos)::procs) pnames =
      if List.exists (fn q=>q=p) pnames
      then raise Error ("Multiply declared procedure "^p,pos)
      else getProcs procs (p::pnames)
\end{verbatim}

\paragraph{Updating identifiers have restrictions due to bijectivity.} When the
updating operators \verb!+=! and \verb!-=! are type checked, the identifier that
is being updated cannot be part of the expression on the right-hand side. For an
update statement, \verb!a += b!, this is demonstrated in the pseudo-code for the
type check: \verb+checkExp(Exp2, vtable, name(id))+, during which an error will
occur if \verb+Exp2+ contains the identifier \verb+id+ (avoid).

A second case to consider is illustrated in the example \verb!foo[foo[0]+2] += bar!.
That is, whether the identifier that is being updated can be part of the
expression that calculates the index of the array on the left-hand side. Since
this sub-expression is not updating anything, and since it must be and is
calculated before the variable can be updated, the statement is
well-defined both forwards and backwards.

\vspace{0.2cm}
The following properties works as expected, as seen in the tests.
\begin{itemize}
\item Conditional statements
\item Loop statements
\item Recursive procedure calls and uncalls
\item Each operator ({\tt +, -, +=, -=, /2, !, \&\&, ||,  <, ==})
\item Arrays
\end{itemize}
