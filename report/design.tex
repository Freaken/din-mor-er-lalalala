\section{Design choices}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We test that variables have the correct type, but we do so by
  explicitly matching \verb+SOME Integer+, \verb+SOME (Array _)+ and
  \verb+NONE+ instead of having a catch-all after the two first. This way, if
  the language is extended, the compiler will give warnings which signify that
  changes need to be added here as well.
\end{itemize}
